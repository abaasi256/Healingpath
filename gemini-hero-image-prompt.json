The environment should feel like a high-end spa meets modern medical facility - clean, welcoming, and sophisticated. Include subtle elements like comfortable seating, fresh plants, and modern medical equipment in soft focus. The overall mood should convey trust, privacy, and premium care while feeling approachable and non-intimidating. Optimize for web use at 1920x1080 resolution with the aesthetic matching a luxury women's healthcare brand."
